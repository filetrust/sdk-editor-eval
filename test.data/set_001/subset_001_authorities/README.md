# Data Description

The file Authorities.docx has Authorities.xlsx embedded in it. 
Authorities_locations.docx lists where the search text "Authorities" is located.
One of the key purposes of this test file is to highlight the boundaries of where the search capability can and can't do replacements. 
Some of the possible redactions are dependant on the homoglyphs file used.
The embedded excel is shown as an image so the search text will not be updated within that image.

# Config

The config file simply searches for the word 'Authorities' and redacts it with the '*' character.
