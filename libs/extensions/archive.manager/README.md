# Archive Manager

## Overview

The Glasswall Archive Manager is a wrapper around the Glasswall CDR (Content Disarm and Reconstruction) Engine. It provides support for Archive file formats by extracting the input archive and handing each file within the archive to the Glasswall engine for processing. The regenerated files or XML analysis reports are then packaged in a brand new archive while preserving the directory structure of the original archive.

### Supported Archive Types

The table below lists the archive formats supported by Glasswall Archive Manager:

| Archive Type             | Description                   |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 7Zip                     | Open architecture compression |
| BZip2                    | open-source file compression  |
| GZip                     | Compression for GNU           |
| Rar (Decompression only) | Roshal Archive compression    |
| Tar                      | Tape Archive                  |
| Zip                      | Lossless data compression     |

## Processing Modes

There are two processing modes, Analysis and Protect.

### Analysis
The input archive is decompressed, each file within the archive is passed to the Glasswall engine for processing in analysis mode, the resulting XML analysis reports are repackaged in a new archive while preserving the original directory structure.

### Protect
The input archive is decompressed, each file within the archive is passed to the Glasswall CDR engine for processing in protect mode, the regenerated files are repackaged in a new archive while preserving the original directory structure.

## Configuration Example
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<config>
    <wordConfig>
        <embedded_files>sanitise</embedded_files>
        <internal_hyperlinks>sanitise</internal_hyperlinks>
        <external_hyperlinks>sanitise</external_hyperlinks>
        <macros>sanitise</macros>
        <metadata>sanitise</metadata>
        <review_comments>sanitise</review_comments>
    </wordConfig>
    <archiveConfig libVersion="core2" defaultCompression="zip">
        <doc>process</doc>
        <docx>discard</docx>
        <pdf>no_action</pdf>
        <jpeg>process</jpeg>
        <elf>discard</elf>
        <obj>process</obj>
    </archiveConfig>
</config>
```

- The word config section of the XML is the configuration that is passed down to the Glasswall engine. See the SDK documentation for more information.
- The archiveConfig section contains the settings for the Glasswall archive manager. Each element within this section is a file type, and the corresponding value is the action that must be performed when a file of this type is encountered when processing an archive. There are three possible actions:
    - **process** - Hand the file to the Glasswall CDR (Content Disarm and Reconstruction) engine for processing.
    - **discard** - The file will be removed from the resulting archive.
    - **no_action** - The file will be copied (unprocessed) to the resulting archive.
    
  The following attributes are required:
    - **libVersion** specifies the Glasswall Engine that should be used, the possible values are:
        - **Classic** – Glasswall Rebuild Engine which can be found [here](https://github.com/filetrust/sdk-rebuild-eval)
        - **Core2** – Glasswall Editor Engine which can be found [here](https://github.com/filetrust/sdk-editor-eval)
    - **defaultCompression** is the fallback archive format that should be used if unable to compress back to the original format (This applies to file types such as RAR where only decompression support is available)
    
    The following attributes are optional:
    - **recursionDepth** can be used to specify the permitted depth of nested subfolders within the archives being processed. Archives exceeding this depth will be blocked and will not be regenerated. If this setting is not specified, the default depth is set to 2 levels. The maximum permitted depth is currently 100 (This is likely to change with future releases).

## API
Each of the APIs returns a `Status` type, which is defined as follows:

```c++
enum Status {
    eFail,
    eSuccess
};
```



### GwFileProtectAndReportArchive

This is used to call the archive manager, process the specified input archive and produce an output archive along with a report.

```
status_t GwFileProtectAndReportArchive(
    void *inputBuffer, 
    size_t inputBufferLength, 
    void **outputFileBuffer, 
    size_t *outputFileBufferLength, 
    void **outputReportBuffer, 
    size_t *outputReportBufferLength, 
    const char *xmlConfigString
    )
```

### GwFileAnalysisArchive

This is used to call the archive manager, process the specified input archive and produce a package (archive) containing reports 
for each file within the processed input archive, as well as a general report for the input archive.

```
status_t GwFileAnalysisArchive(
    void *inputBuffer, 
    size_t inputBufferLength, 
    void **outputFileBuffer, 
    size_t *outputFileBufferLength, 
    void **outputAnalysisReportBuffer, 
    size_t *outputAnalysisReportBufferLength, 
    const char *xmlConfigString
    )
```

### GwArchiveDone

This is used to release any resources that have been allocated by the archive manager. This function needs to be called after each call made to the 'GwFileAnalysisArchive' or 'GwFileProtectAndReportArchive' function otherwise memory leaks may occur.

```
void GwArchiveDone()
```

## Example 
**TBD**
